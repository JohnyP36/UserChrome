# UserChrome
The `userChrome.css` are for FireFox and Thunderbird </br>
My aim is to make FireFox look like Edge but better and make Tunderbird look like Outlook 2003

### How to copy the files
**For Firefox**: 
 - Copy all folders and the two file into your `chrome` folder
     - it should be under `C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\x.default-release\` 
     - if you don't see that folder, create one
 - Put the content of the `user.js` file in `C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\x.default-release\prefs.js` 
    - only copy rules starting with `user_pref(`
